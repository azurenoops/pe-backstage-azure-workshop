# Hands-on Lab - Platform engineering for Federal with BackStage

Welcome to this Platform engineering for Federal Workshop. In order to comprehend real-world situations, you will be testing with Azure services in several labs. Don't worry; you will be walked through the entire procedure in this step-by-step lab.

You will receive guidance on how to do each step throughout this workshop. Before seeing the solutions listed under the provided resources and links, it is advised to look at the solutions placed under the 'ðŸ“š Toggle solution' panel.

## Pre-requisites

Before starting this lab, be sure to set your Azure environment :

- An Azure Subscription with the **Owner** role to create and manage the labs' resources and deploy the infrastructure as code
- Register the Azure providers on your Azure Subscription if not done yet: `Microsoft.DevCenter`, `Microsoft.KeyVault`, `Microsoft.ApiManagement`, `Microsoft.Web`, `Microsoft.App`.

To be able to do the lab content you will also need:

- Basic understanding of Azure resources.
- A Github account (Free, Team or Enterprise)
- Create a [fork][repo-fork] of the repository from the **main** branch to help you keep track of your potential changes


3 development options are available:
  - ðŸ¥‡ **Preferred method** : Pre-configured GitHub Codespace 
  - ðŸ¥ˆ Local Devcontainer
  - ðŸ¥‰ Local Dev Environment with all the prerequisites detailed below

<div class="tip" data-title="Tips">

> To focus on the main purpose of the lab, we encourage the usage of devcontainers/codespace as they abstract the dev environment configuration, and avoid potential local dependencies conflict.
> 
> You could decide to run everything without relying on a devcontainer : To do so, make sure you install all the prerequisites detailed below.
