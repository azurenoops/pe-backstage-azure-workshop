# Hands-on Lab - Platform engineering for Federal with BackStage

Welcome to this Platform engineering for Federal Workshop. In order to comprehend real-world situations, you will be testing with Azure services in several labs.
You will be able to learn how to deploy and manage Azure resources, as well as how to use Azure services to build and deploy applications with the help of GitHub and Backstage.
Don't worry; you will be walked through the entire procedure in this step-by-step lab.

You will receive guidance on how to do each step throughout this workshop. You will be able to test your knowledge and skills by completing the labs.
Before seeing the solutions listed under the provided resources and links, it is advised to look at the solutions placed under the 'ðŸ“š Toggle solution' panel.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> You will find the instructions and expected configurations for each Lab step in these yellow **TASK** boxes.
> Inputs and parameters to select will be defined, all the rest can remain as default as it has no impact on the scenario.

</div>

## Pre-requisites

Before starting this lab, be sure to set your Azure environment :

- An Azure Subscription with the **Owner** role to create and manage the labs' resources and deploy the infrastructure as code
- Register the Azure providers on your Azure Subscription if not done yet: `Microsoft.KeyVault`, `Microsoft.ApiManagement`, `Microsoft.Web`, `Microsoft.App`.

To be able to do the lab content you will also need:

- Basic understanding of Azure resources.
- A Github account (Free, Team or Enterprise)
- Create a [fork][repo-fork] of the repository from the **main** branch to help you keep track of your potential changes


3 development options are available:
  - ðŸ¥‡ **Preferred method** : Pre-configured GitHub Codespace 
  - ðŸ¥ˆ Local Devcontainer
  - ðŸ¥‰ Local Dev Environment with all the prerequisites detailed below

<div class="tip" data-title="Tips">

> To focus on the main purpose of the lab, we encourage the usage of devcontainers/codespace as they abstract the dev environment configuration, and avoid potential local dependencies conflict.
> 
> You could decide to run everything without relying on a devcontainer : To do so, make sure you install all the prerequisites detailed below.

</div>

### ðŸ¥‡ : Pre-configured GitHub Codespace

To use a Github Codespace, you will need :
- [A GitHub Account][github-account]

Github Codespace offers the ability to run a complete dev environment (Visual Studio Code, Extensions, Tools, Secure port forwarding etc.) on a dedicated virtual machine. 
The configuration for the environment is defined in the `.devcontainer` folder, making sure everyone gets to develop and practice on identical environments : No more conflict on dependencies or missing tools ! 

Every Github account (even the free ones) grants access to 120 vcpu hours per month, _**for free**_. A 2 vcpu dedicated environment is enough for the purpose of the lab, meaning you could run such environment for 60 hours a month at no cost!

To get your codespace ready for the labs, here are a few steps to execute : 
- Start by forking the repository. Click on `Fork` and get a new copy of the repository which is now yours and that you can edit at your will.
- After you forked the repo, click on `<> Code`, `Codespaces` tab and then click on the `+` button:

![codespace-new](../../assets/lab0-prerequisites/codespace-new.png)

- You can also provision a beefier configuration by defining creation options and select the **Machine Type** you like: 

![codespace-configure](../../assets/lab0-prerequisites/codespace-configure.png)

### ðŸ¥ˆ : Using a local Devcontainer

This repo comes with a Devcontainer configuration that will let you open a fully configured dev environment from your local Visual Studio Code, while still being completely isolated from the rest of your local machine configuration : No more dependency conflict.
Here are the required tools to do so : 

- [Git client][git-client] 
- [Docker Desktop][docker-desktop] running
- [Visual Studio Code][vs-code] installed

Start by cloning the Hands-on Lab Platform engineering for Federal repo you just forked on your local Machine and open the local folder in Visual Studio Code.
Once you have cloned the repository locally, make sure Docker Desktop is up and running and open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.  

You will be prompted to open the project in a Dev Container. Click on `Reopen in Container`. 

If you are not prompted by Visual Studio Code, you can open the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and search for `Reopen in Container` and select it: 

![devcontainer-reopen](../../assets/lab0-prerequisites/devcontainer-reopen.png)

### ðŸ¥‰ : Using your own local environment

The following tools and access will be necessary to run the lab in good conditions on a local environment :  

- [Git client][git-client] 
- [Visual Studio Code][vs-code] installed (you will use Dev Containers)
- [Azure CLI][az-cli-install] installed on your machine
- [Terraform][terraform-install] installed, this will be used for deploying the resources on Azure

Once you have set up your local environment, you can clone the Hands-on Lab Platform engineering for Federal repo you just forked on your machine, and open the local folder in Visual Studio Code and head to the next step. 

## ðŸ”‘ Sign in to Azure

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Log into your Azure subscription in your environment using Azure CLI and on the [Azure Portal][az-portal] using your credentials.

# Module 2 - Lab 1 - Install Backstage

In this lab, we will initialize the standalone app for the moment. In the later labs we will add an external database to it and deploy it to Azure. As well as, do some configurarion to make it work with Azure and GitHub.

To get set up quickly with your own Backstage project you can create a Backstage App.

A Backstage App is a monorepo setup with `lerna` that includes everything you need to run Backstage in your own environment.

## Step 1 - Create a Backstage App

Backstage provides a utility for creating new apps. It guides you through the initial setup of selecting the name of the app and a database for the backend. The database options are either `SQLite` or `PostgreSQL`, where the latter requires you to set up a separate database instance.

To create a new app, run the following command:

```shell
npx @backstage/create-app@latest
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

```shell
npx @backstage/create-app@latest
```

If prompted, enter a name for the app. This will be the name of the directory that is created. I suggest to
use `backstage`

```shell
? Enter a name for the app [required] backstage

 All set! Now you might want to:
  Run the app: cd backstage && yarn dev
  Set up the software catalog: https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/configuration
  Add authentication: https://backstage.io/docs/auth/
```

</details>

This can take a few minutes to complete. But you should see the current progress in the terminal.

You should now have a new directory called `backstage` in your root directory, which contains following files and
folders:

```shell
backstage/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ app-config.local.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ app-config.production.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ app-config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ backstage.json
â”œâ”€â”€ catalog-info.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ dist-types
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.tsbuildinfo
â”œâ”€â”€ examples
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ org.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ template
â”œâ”€â”€ lerna.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

â”œâ”€â”€ plugins
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock
```

* **app-config.yaml**: Main configuration file for the app.
* **catalog-info.yaml**: Catalog Entities descriptors.
* **lerna.json**: Contains information about workspaces and other lerna configuration needed for the monorepo setup.
* **package.json**: Root package.json for the project. Note: Be sure that you don't add any npm dependencies here as
  they
  probably should be installed in the intended workspace rather than in the root.
* **packages/**: Lerna leaf packages or "workspaces". Everything here is going to be a separate package, managed by
  lerna.
* **packages/app/**: An fully functioning Backstage frontend app, that acts as a good starting point for you to get to
  know
  Backstage.
* **packages/backend/**: The backend for Backstage. This is where you can add your own backend logic.

## Step 2 - Run the App

As soon as the app is created, you can run it by navigating into the `backstage` directory and running the following command:

```shell
cd backstage
yarn dev
```

The yarn dev command will run both the frontend and backend as separate processes (named [0] and [1]) in the same
window. When the command finishes running, it should open up a browser window displaying your app. If not, you can open
a browser and directly navigate to the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

```shell
cd backstage
yarn dev
```

</details>

## Step 3 - Explore the App

Let's have a look on some of the values in the different files and change them to your needs.

![backstage-home](./assets/lab1-backstage/backstage-home.png)

First we change the name of our organization in the `app-config.yaml` file. Open the file and change the organization name to a name of your choice.

```yaml
organization:
  name: <your organization name>
```

Because we are still in the development mode, any changes to the `app-config.yaml` file will be reflected in the app as soon as you save the file. You can see the changes in the browser window.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> If you do not see the changes in the browser window, try to refresh the page.

</div>

## Step 4 - Add GitHub Auth Integration

The Backstage `core-plugin-api` package comes with a Microsoft authentication provider that can authenticate users using GitHub or GitHub Enterprise OAuth.

### Create an OAuth App on GitHub

To add GitHub authentication, you must create either a GitHub App, or an OAuth App from the GitHub developer settings. The Homepage URL should point to Backstage's frontend, while the Authorization callback URL will point to the auth backend.

Note that if you're using a GitHub App, the allowed scopes are configured as part of that app. This means you need to verify what scopes the plugins you use require, so be sure to check the plugin READMEs for that information.

Settings for local development:

- **Application name**: Backstage (or your custom app name)
- **Homepage URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Authorization callback URL:** http://localhost:7007/api/auth/github/handler/frame

### Configure GitHub Auth in Backstage

The provider configuration can then be added to your app-config.yaml under the root auth configuration:

```yaml

auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    github:
      development:
        clientId: ${AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
        ## uncomment if using GitHub Enterprise
        # enterpriseInstanceUrl: ${AUTH_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_INSTANCE_URL}
        signIn:
          resolvers:
            # See https://backstage.io/docs/auth/github/provider#resolvers for more resolvers
            - resolver: usernameMatchingUserEntityName

```

The GitHub provider is a structure with these configuration keys:

- **clientId:** The client ID that you generated on GitHub, e.g. b59241722e3c3b4816e2
- **clientSecret:** The client secret tied to the generated client ID.
- **enterpriseInstanceUrl (optional):** The base URL for a GitHub Enterprise instance, e.g. https://ghe.<company>.com. Only needed for GitHub Enterprise.
- **callbackUrl (optional):** The callback URL that GitHub will use when initiating an OAuth flow, e.g. https://your-intermediate-service.com/handler. Only needed if Backstage is not the immediate receiver (e.g. one OAuth app for many backstage instances).
- **signIn:** The configuration for the sign-in process, including the resolvers that should be used to match the user from the auth provider with the user entity in the Backstage catalog (typically a single resolver is sufficient).

### GitHub Resolvers

This provider includes several resolvers out of the box that you can use:

- **emailMatchingUserEntityProfileEmail:** Matches the email address from the auth provider with the User entity that has a matching spec.profile.email. If no match is found it will throw a NotFoundError.
- **emailLocalPartMatchingUserEntityName:** Matches the local part of the email address from the auth provider with the User entity that has a matching name. If no match is found it will throw a NotFoundError.
- **usernameMatchingUserEntityName:** Matches the username from the auth provider with the User entity that has a matching name. If no match is found it will throw a NotFoundError.

<div class="note" data-title="Note">

> The resolvers will be tried in order, but will only be skipped if they throw a NotFoundError.

</div>

### Backend Installation

To add the provider to the backend we will first need to install the package by running this command:

```typescript

from your Backstage root directory

yarn --cwd packages/backend add @backstage/plugin-auth-backend-module-github-provider

```

Then we will need to this line:

```typescript

in packages/backend/src/index.ts

backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-auth-backend'));
backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-auth-backend-module-github-provider'));

```

### Adding the provider to the Backstage frontend

To add the provider to the frontend we will first need to install the package by running this command:

```typescript

in packages/app/src/App.tsx

import { githubAuthApiRef } from '@backstage/core-plugin-api';
import { SignInPage } from '@backstage/core-components';

const app = createApp({
 components: {
    SignInPage: props => (
      <SignInPage
        {...props}
        auto
        provider={{
          id: 'github-auth-provider',
          title: 'GitHub',
          message: 'Sign in using GitHub',
          apiRef: githubAuthApiRef,
        }}
      />
    ),
  },
  // ..
});
```

<div class="note" data-title="Note">  

> You can configure sign-in to use a redirect flow with no pop-up by adding enableExperimentalRedirectFlow: true to the root of your app-config.yaml

</div>

You have completed the first lab. You have created a new Backstage app and explored the app.

# Module 3 - Lab 3 - Path Paths

In this lab, we will discuss how to implement paved paths in Backstage. Paved paths are predefined paths that provide a set of best practices and configurations for specific types of applications.

## Step 1 - Add Microsoft Entra ID Catalog Integration

The Backstage catalog can be set up to ingest organizational data - users and teams - directly from a tenant in Microsoft Entra ID via the Microsoft Graph API.

### Installation

The package is not installed by default, therefore you have to add @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-msgraph to your backend package.

```typescript

from your Backstage root directory

yarn --cwd packages/backend add @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-msgraph
```

Next add the basic configuration to app-config.yaml

```yaml

catalog:
  providers:
    microsoftGraphOrg:
      default:
        tenantId: ${AZURE_TENANT_ID}
        user:
          filter: accountEnabled eq true and userType eq 'member'
        group:
          filter: >
            securityEnabled eq false
            and mailEnabled eq true
            and groupTypes/any(c:c+eq+'Unified')
        schedule:
          frequency: PT1H
          timeout: PT50M

```

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> For large organizations, this plugin can take a long time, so be careful setting low frequency / timeouts and importing a large amount of users / groups for the first try.

> The configuration above is a basic configuration for the Microsoft Graph API. You can find more information about the configuration in the [Backstage documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/catalog-integrations#microsoft-graph).

</div>

Finally, updated your backend by adding the following line:

```typescript

in packages/backend/src/index.ts

backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend'));
backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-msgraph'));
```

## Step 2 - Add GitHub Integration to Backstage

 


## Implementing Paved Paths in Backstage

In Backstage, paved paths can be implemented using the scaffolder plugin. The scaffolder plugin allows you to create templates for different types of applications and generate new projects based on those templates.

To implement paved paths in Backstage, you can create a new template in the `examples/template` directory. The template should include all the necessary configuration and best practices for a specific type of application.

You can then use the scaffolder plugin to generate new projects based on the template. The scaffolder plugin will create a new project in the `packages` directory with all the necessary configuration and best practices.
